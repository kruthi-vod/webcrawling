Name,Review
Cory Woodroof,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is going to have the same effect on today’s kids that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom had on kids in the 80s, and I mean that as the highest compliment."
Kip Mooney,This third volume [is] a mixed bag.
Stephen Silver,"The first strong effort from Marvel in a while, as the Rocket story drives the plot, and attaches real stakes in a way these film usually don’t."
Kent Garrison,Why am I crying about a raccoon?
Rachel Ho,"Boy, does Gunn come out guns blazing."
Luis Bond,"Gunn says goodbye to Marvel Studios in style, leaving his wake in the genre and giving us a valuable personal lesson that we must never forget: we all deserve a second chance [Full Review in Spanish]"
Chris Sawin,"Tearfully moving with bonkers humor, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 gives the world’s most bad ass trash panda from space the most meaningful film in a trilogy overrun with super heroic and perfection obsessed a-holes."
Matt Donato,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a tailor-fitted exit for James Gunn from Marvel’s Cinematic Universe ... the Gunniest Guardians yet in the best way.
Marie Asner,"The heart of the film, though, is Rocket."
Josh Flanders,"While better than most recent Marvel or DC films, it definitely lacks the fun, buddy-film aspects and sincere relationships of the original in lieu of an exhausting mission-based story."
Sarah El-Mahmoud,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is another stylish, laugh-out-loud, offbeat and most of all, Awesome Mix of being something beautifully human and alien at the same time."
Matt Singer,Completes Rocket’ transformation from a footnote to one of Marvel’ greatest characters.
Ryan McQuade,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was surprisingly emotional and has some nice finality for James Gunn.
Christy Lemire,Too often it feels like James Gunn made a playlist of songs he likes and then came up with scenes to go with them.
Bruce R. Miller,"If this is the last episode of the series (could that really be true?), it’s done with great care and concern. Director James Gunn knows how to fire up the faithful. Now, he just needs to point out who they are."
Kathia Woods,The heart and soul of Guardians has always been the camaraderie of the cast.
Brian Gill,What if the real raccoons are the friends we made along the way?
Rosa Parra,“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” is the perfect conclusion to this group of superheroes who “take ass and kick names.” A heartfelt farewell to the most grounded and memorable family in film
Lynn Venhaus,",,,having this motley crew back together one more time has deepened their ties, softened their tough exteriors, and created playful exchanges that enhance what is a dense and convoluted story."
Ray Pride,"A joyous sweetheart of a movie; even better is that it plays like a movie, not a Marvel product... What’s it about? Raccoons and kindness. And gleefully bad gags. Gunn’s sheer competence soars alongside his customary monumental goofiness."
Wenlei Ma,Guardians 3 is a real warm and fuzzy movie that sometimes makes you forget that you’re a bit bored with the onslaught of superhero movies.
Dennis Schwartz,A goofy and incohesive adventure tale of an intergalactic band of artificially created misfits.
Carla Renata,Chukwudi Iwuji as The High Evolutionary commands the screen and upstages everyone on it each and every time he appears with mad scientist vibes disguised as compassion making him more than compelling to watch. Oh yeaH! That soundtrack is absolute fire!
Tony Baker,"Rocket is already my favorite Guardian, so now to see how he became who he became -- it's heartbreaking."
Abby Olcese,"If you’re looking for a way to conclude your relationship with Marvel’s most vibrant characters, this is it. Given signs of diminishing returns here, it’s also a good example of quitting while you’re ahead."
Robert Roten,"There is plenty of humor, along with a bit of romance, some cliffhangers, some pathos and a lot of action in this fast-paced story. It is a good example of why Marvel movies are so popular."
Valerie Kalfrin,"an eclectic and affectionate mixtape that’s funny, thrilling, shattering, and bittersweet."
Theolin Tembo,"Ultimately, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a thoroughly enjoyable film that, while it works best for those who have followed the franchise, it does also work as a film you can watch without context."
Omar Holmon,"There was always something that was funny, witty, or heart wrenching that covered for any cliché that appeared."
Beth Accomando,"I was surprised by how sad, emotional, and dark this third film was."
Kevin A. Ranson,"Gunn is committed to viewers understanding the horrors of being unmade and remade, inflicting a level of emotion and empathy few Marvel movies have achieved and earning every bit of crass humor as necessary moments to catch your breath."
Susan Granger,"Under the aegis of writer/director James Gunn, Rocket Raccoon's origin story turns out to be heavy-handed and bizarrely grotesque."
Dwight Brown,"Be forewarned, it’s a slog for the first 90 minutes of its 2h 30m length. Then real energy kicks in."
Louisa Moore,"Despite the film’s bloated length and tendency to embrace nostalgia without an ounce of moderation, it’s a fitting and heartfelt sendoff for the beloved crew of misfit mercenaries."
Mark Jackson,"Garish, with an over-prolonged animal version of Sid's creepy, mutant, cobbled-together, depressing toys from ""Toy Story,"" it's got enough animal abuse for your kids to eventually need therapy sessions. Director Gunn's gone. Somebody bring back the fun."
Matt Hudson,"It isn’t top-tier Marvel but it’s damn solid with some great gags and action throughout. Compared to recent MCU releases, however, it’s a rousing success."
Sandie Angulo Chen,"Writer-director James Gunn knows how to make this ragtag bunch work, but there's a layer of sadness that envelops the proceedings, despite the many laugh-out-loud moments."
Hanna Flint,"As swansongs go, Gunn’s farewell to the MCU is finely tuned."
Alejandro Turdo,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is by far one the strongest entries in the post-Endgame era. A classic adventure with a lot of heart that makes the most out of its core characters, consequentially bringing the saga to a well deserved solid closure."
Ed Whitfield,"Gunn falls prey to franchise imperatives and Marvel cultural mores. More is more, leaving less and less screen time for the human story."
tt stern-enzi,James Gunn has an incredible way of balancing the mix of humor and heart... and has gotten bigger and better with that.
Cris Kennedy,"Flashy, fun and funny, it honours its main characters..."
Kevin Fox Jr.,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 makes use of what comes before without being totally bogged down. It’s a working film product, if not a superlatively meaningful work of art."
Rich Cline,"There's a strong central plot running through this epic, but it's so cluttered that it can be tricky to keep track of it."
Joseph Garcia,"The funny – and occasionally challenging – film eschews universal stakes for emotional ones, giving us a bittersweet send-off for the ragtag heroes."
Richard Brody,"The fact that Gunn himself, as writer and director, has an unusual degree of authority, and thereby seems to be largely constraining himself, renders the narrow results all the more oppressive."
Isaac Feldberg,"Vol. 3 scales up with an excessive 150-minute runtime but commits that length to splashing Gunn’s signature brand of gooey sentimentality across the biggest, loudest, most color-mad canvas that a Disney budget can afford."
Linda Cook,I cried twice.
Steven Redgrave,"This is a fitting conclusion to Gunn's iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, full of heart and comedy, cementing an unknown B-team into a memorable A-team of A-holes."
Crockett Houghton,"From visually stunning images to the biggest action scenes to the comedy and the heart, the family, and the journey, Guardians of The Galaxy Vol 3 had a lot to live up to, and it's easily the best Marvel movie since End Game."
Tom Shone,"With two villains instead of one, an endless succession of rescues and more endings than The Lord of the Rings, volume three is the same bloated two-and-a-half-hour leviathan as every other Marvel movie these days."
Brian Viner,"Gunn goes the whole hog with the animals in this film, from cute talking dogs to mutant pigs and even heart-rending scenes in a jail cell featuring a raccoon, a walrus and an otter."
Bob Grimm,"Not as good as the Christmas special, but still pretty good."
Ruben Peralta Rigaud,"With great attention to detail, a perfect mixture of music, action, humor, and grand emotion, has been created. [Full review in Spanish]"
TK Burton,"Unlike some of the recent less-satisfying [MCU] entries, there’s a pretty solid, funny, heartfelt entry here amidst the cacophony of space battles and monsters and general James Gunn weirdness."
Nick Hasted,"There is still the familiar pleasure of the Guardians’ company, free of the Avengers’ government-sponsored gravitas. Gunn is too fond of them for a cruel last go-round, kindly completing their story."
Tim Brennan,"The final film in the Guardians franchise never feels like it was made by committee or Chat GPT. It’s got loads of action, lots of heart, and could only have been made by James Gunn."
Alci Rengifo,The movie packs both grandeur and grit.
Abbie Bernstein,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is enjoyable, has true affection for its people and ends as it should."
Sebastian Zavala Kahn,"Those who already love these characters will laugh and cry with the film, and those who know little or nothing about them will still have a good time (though again, if you're an animal lover, you should bring a box of Kleenex). Full review in Spanish."
Wendy Ide,"A picture that balances a slightly overstuffed storyline with mischief, humour and the biggest of hearts."
Matt Neal,How can you be fatigued about superhero movies when they're this good?
Felix Vasquez Jr.,Just wonderful from beginning to end.
Allen Almachar,"Because it doesn’t shy away from taking chances, and because it embraces its oddball quirkiness like a benefit and not a hindrance, it becomes endearing."
Patrick Hicks,"Yet another big, loud, and fun intergalactic adventure. Worthy of the big screen and your time, even at two plus hours with some tough to swallow animal violence, it manages to send off its main characters in an emotionally satisfying way."
Ryan Silberstein,"Beyond the found family dynamic, if these movies have a central theme, it’s these losers spitting in the eye of (a) god as payback for existing in a universe that is uncaring at best."
Michael Ward,...enjoyable but inconsistent.
Jessie Gender,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 not only provides an emotional ending to James Gunn's time with this crew; but also delivers the strongest and most meaningful, both in its characterization and its anti-fascist message, MCU movie since Avengers: Endgame."
Richard Roeper,"A funny, big-hearted adventure."
Keith Garlington,"It’s an overprocessed send-off that’s so focused on going out with a bang that it loses its joy, charm, and trust in us to actually feel things on our own."
Edwin Arnaudin,The first MCU film to make grown men cry and traumatize their kids.
Vincent Mancini,Marvel's best movie in at least five years -- and then it goes on for another 40 awful minutes.
Candice McMillan,"A solemn, but heartfelt, authentically unique, though consistently brazen spin around the universe ... the most personal and profound of the three films."
Noah Berlatsky,"When the Guardians get into a big group hug at the end of the film, it’s supposed to evoke love and solidarity. But it might better be characterized as the unity of capital, determined to offend no one and turn no one’s dollars away."
Alison Gillmor,"A kooky, messy grab-bag of a flick, the third and reportedly final entry in the Guardians of the Galaxy saga mixes up the good, the bad and the completely bizarre with lots of gonzo energy but sometimes questionable judgment."
Patrick McDonald,"90% of this was the situational emotion, and I didn't connect. It became a formula of several fighting encounters, too many new characters and the High Evolutionary villain screaming every line until there was no more scenery to chew. Yo Space Adrian!"
Richard Propes,"I laughed a lot throughout Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 but, perhaps most surprisingly of all, I realized how much I cared about these Guardians and their presence in my galaxy."
Neal Pollack,A rollicking space action comedy that also happens to be a treatise on the ethics of experimenting on animals.
Collin Garbarino,"Gunn signals the somber direction in the opening scene and carries it through to the end credits. It’s not necessarily a darker movie, just ­sadder, and some fans won’t be ­prepared for the goofy franchise turning into a bit of a tear-jerker."
Lupe Rodriguez Haas,"Cutting back and forth between the light-hearted moments with the Guardians, and young Rocket’s story is jarring in tone and slows down the pacing. It’s surprising Marvel Studios approved such morbid imagery of mutilated critters."
David Lynch,"Gunn the true-blue genre imagineer has almost always been able to pick up the slack from Gunn the overcompensating writer, even as the latter can’t resist to show every character that speaks, roars or chortles how much he loves them."
Ruth Maramis,Gunn gets melancholic in his farewell to Marvel but hasn't lost his sense of fun. Rocket's backstory gets me bawling but there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to balance the somber mood.
José Roberto Landaverde,"A near-perfect sendoff for the team. Dark, happy and risky in every way. [Full review in Spanish]"
John Urbancich,"Franchise loyalists should remember to stick around for the affectionate mid-credits salute to all the departing players, not to mention a giant clue at the very end about future endeavors for ""Star-Lord"" Quill."
Karen M. Peterson,"The film, and especially its final moments, find that delicate balance between giving the audience enough and leaving them wanting more."
David Poland,"Very, very few people will come out of the movie unhappy. But many will have the uncomfortable feeling that they should have been more satisfied, not as interested in deconstruction as I and other film writers are."
Micheal Compton,"It all adds up to a fitting swan song for one of the most beloved groups in the Marvel Comics Universe. If this is truly the end, it’s been a fun and rather memorable ride."
Erik Kain,"James Gunn sticks the landing with the third and final Guardians movie. It’s an emotionally powerful, wildly inventive, often hilarious tour de force farewell for our ragtag band of intergalactic space heroes."
Tori Brazier,An unwieldy and unexpectedly emotional mess that will win you over.
Andre Meadows,What really makes this movie work is that it has heart. You could just feel the love that is poured into this movie.
Nick Johnston,"It’s often surprisingly effective at tugging on the viewer’s heartstrings. But that application of personal investment and care to an enterprise that would, in another’s hands, be soulless and generic is what Gunn did best during his time at Disney,"
Kevin Carr,"Less about Star Lord’s hang ups and more a character study of Rocket, this offers an intriguing diversion from the previous films."
Miles Surrey,"Marvel will miss James Gunn more than Gunn will miss Marvel, but if there’s any way for the MCU to get out of its current funk, then ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’ should be the blueprint going forward."
Damond Fudge,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is exciting, funny, heartbreakingly emotional and the perfect send-off...[it] proves that the “movie with the talking racoon” has come a long way…and burrowed itself deep into our hearts."
Thelma Adams,"For ""Guardian"" junkies and kids of all stripes, this two-hour reunion with old character friends will have them singing Peaches & Herb’s 1978 soul classic “Reunited” -- and it feels so good."
Piers Marchant,"This ""Guardians"" doesn't come with the same verve and moxie as the first two, but there is, at least, a sense of growth."
Mike McGranaghan,"Even if this third outing doesn’t quite hit the heights of Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, it still avoids the “been there, done that” quality that has felled a few of the other recent Marvel releases."
Doug Walker,Feels more like an imitation of a 'Guardians' movie rather than an actual 'Guardians' movie.
Lyra Hale,"GOT3 destroyed me because it made me self-reflect. And those are the kind of movies that stay with you. Because yes, this is a movie about aliens, epic battles in space, etc. But this is also a story about belonging and self-acceptance."
Radheyan Simonpillai,Flirts with being interesting but I checked out after the 90 minute mark with nearly an hour to go.
Lisa Johnson Mandell,"With just the right amount of comedy, drama, sentiment, action and a soundtrack full of well-placed rock classics, writer/director James Gunn has reached a cosmic balance."
Liz Shannon Miller,"As a final chapter for this trilogy, Vol. 3 works. But of the three films, it’s the weakest."
Ryan Syrek,"As a fan of Cronenbergian body horror, is it hypocritical to find “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” repulsive for its copious CGI animal torture? No! Because fuzzy creatures didn’t invent genocide, Twitter, or the 50-hour work week."
Mathew DeKinder,"“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” hits all the quirky, comedic and heartfelt notes that made the first two movies such a blast."
Jeff Nelson,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 concludes Gunn’s trilogy on a positive note, reminding us why we ever fell in love with this band of misfits, and giving us even more reasons to look back on their journey with fondness."
Aaron Peterson,"Disney did the right thing by bringing Gunn back after unceremoniously firing him over years-old tweets. Gunn IS this franchise, and by doing so Disney saved the Guardians, our joy, and possibly the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole."
Chris Knight,"Rocket’s backstory, though often overshadowed by exploding spaceships, space stations and planets, is actually kind of sweet. As an urban Canadian, I have to say that anything that makes me feel sympathy for a raccoon is clearly doing something right."
James Verniere,Gunn may have made a new version of Tod Browning's Freaks for the masses.
Christopher Lloyd,"More downbeat and grim, but still plenty of laughs and camaraderie in this final (?) outing for the galactic do-gooders."
Michael Phillips,"It trashes the camaraderie of its core ensemble in favor of one deafening, vicious flourish after another."
Ian Thomas Malone,"Vol. 3 is not a stellar sendoff by any means, but Gunn delivers some of the most ambitious filmmaking of the MCU’s post-Endgame era."
Rendy Jones,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 might bite off more than it can chew, but its focus on character growth, dazzling action, and rocking playlist has James Gunn going out with his galactic-found family in style."
Tom Santilli,"...awesome on a number of different levels. It's also my favorite Marvel movie at least since ""Avengers: End Game,"" and perhaps of all-time."
Adam Kempenaar,"Mercifully, Gunn gives us a Phase whatever Marvel movie that is self-contained - more GCU than MCU."
Grant Rollings,It is full of so much blink-and-you-miss-it humour that I’d like to watch Guardians 3 again. None of this could work without the characters whose flaws are played up for comic effect by judicious pairings.
Eric Marchen,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, though imperfect, bids a fond farewell to the ragtag crew of misfits with Rocket Raccoon finally at the forefront."
Linda and Al Lerner,"Come for the music and the visual effects, not so much for the disjointed depressing story. While The Guardians work to save the world, it’s too bad that James Gunn and the crew couldn’t save this movie."
Rain Jokinen,[D]on't say I didn't warn you.
Johnny Gayzmonic,"I went into this film suffering superhero burn-out, and I came out of it with the most wonderful and comforting form of heartbreak. And I can only say thank you."
Adam Olinger,"The Guardians of the Galaxy now sits next to The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars (OG) and Back to the Future as one of the greatest movie trilogies of all-time."
Mark Meszoros,You’ll laugh. You may cry. You’ll probably hold your breath. And you’ll almost certainly think a bit about animal experimentation.
Sonny Bunch,"It’s entirely possible that Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 is the last gasp of [the MCU's] once-invulnerable cultural wrecking ball."
Peter Travers,For all its backsliding into bleak—stop torturing Bradley Cooper's talking raccoon—this spirited summer kickoff delivers the requisite thrill ride and ends the GOTG trilogy with the sweet sorrow of saying goodbye to these space dorks. It’s been a trip.
Maggie Lovitt,"With The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3. James Gunn stuffs it full of all of his hallmarks to craft a fitting send-off for this band of misfits. The film is a certified heartfelt feast, even if there is a lot to process all at once."
M.N. Miller,James Gunn and the company have put a stamp on the honest-to-God wackiest and most heartfelt Marvel franchise ever.
Rafer Guzman,"Overall, “Vol. 3” does everything a final film should — if it really is a final film, that is."
Odie Henderson,"A movie is only as good as its bad guy, and I dreaded having to spend time with him."
Chris Hewitt,"Uneven though it may be, ""Vol. 3"" continues to demonstrate that Gunn has a unique skill set."
Sara Michelle Fetters,"Not only is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 my favorite film of the series, but it’s also quite possibly the best entry in the entire MCU."
Ricardo Gallegos,"A magnificent conclusion, an ode to the imperfect and the weirdos... [Full Review in Spanish]"
Tanner Gordon,"There will probably never be another Marvel film like this again, a film so expressly about empathy, pushing forward against the odds in the messy, unpredictable path towards renewal."
Jeffrey Harris,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3. is the most heart-wrenching, emotional adventure yet for the galaxy's biggest, most lovable misfits. James Gunn delivers a grand, yet poignant, sendoff for the Guardians. These morons will be missed."
Gayle Sequeira,"It doesn't entirely escape the fast-drying cement of MCU convention, but in true James Gunn style, it goes down swinging. It's an ode to the places we’ve been, the people we’ve become, and the questions we’ll have to ask ourselves about where we go next."
Russ Simmons,“Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3” is a snappy and involving comic book extravaganza.
Jeffrey M. Anderson,It will bring a smile to your face and perhaps a tear to your eye — and it is all-around lovable — but it needed a firmer hand.
Sean P. Means,"Everything in “Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3” hints that this is our group’s last ride together, and that’s OK because it’s such an enjoyable ride."
Brian Eggert,Gunn’s work registers as that of a filmmaker with a personal vision for his comic book universe and the freedom to explore it.
Kyle Smith,"GOTG 3 is a blahbuster that, like other recent Marvel disappointments, jogs along from one visually extravagant, strenuously jokey set piece to another without offering much in the way of either dramatic engagement or actually funny ideas."
Jeremy Jahns,"Ironically -- and even sadly -- Guardians 3 feels more like a familiar MCU formula film, rather than the unique vision that started Guardians of the Galaxy in the first place."
Jake Wilson,Gunn wouldn’t be Gunn if he wasn’t compelled to mix sweetness with viciousness -- but... At this point the sadistic side of his imagination is out in the open.
Kate Rodger,"[Vol. 3] totally sticks the landing, bringing this beloved slice of the Marvel franchise to a nourishing close, dancing across the finish line to the tune of another blockbuster soundtrack and reminding me how much I just adore going to the movies."
Cody Leach,"GOTG 3 brings big emotions, high stakes, and a refreshingly serious tone that add up to a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Weak villains and a thin story hold it back from true greatness but these characters & their dynamic continue to shine."
Preston Barta,"'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' is about as exceptional as blockbuster entertainment gets. In many ways, it’s the 'Toy Story 3' of Marvel movies. It rocks!"
Donald Clarke,Watching the thing is like trying to drink water from something more powerful than the proverbial fire hose. It’s like putting your head back to be waterbombed by the same service’s aerial forest-fire team.
André Hereford,James Gunn closes his 'Guardians of the Galaxy' trilogy with more gravitas than goofiness amid rockin’ interstellar set-pieces.
Robert Denerstein,"At two hours and 29 minutes, Guardians can be accused of bloat. But Rocket’s origin story settles the movie down, building toward what many will regard as an emotionally satisfying conclusion."
Paul Salfen,"The band has broken up, but maybe it's for the better. It's a bit of a downer. Some might love this one, but it made me long for when it felt like the first time."
Bilge Ebiri,"The big-picture elements of Guardians 3 work beautifully, but so do the specifics."
Juanma Fernández París,Gunn ingeniously reclaims each of the characters and gives them dramatic depth...
Nell Minow,"Like its characters, a mess but a lovable and entertaining mess. By now it feels like it’s our mess. So, even though I couldn’t help imagining what Honest Trailers and Pitch Meeting are going to have so say about it, I enjoyed it"
Conor O'Donnell,"All of this is funneled through a space oddity pastiche that feels pre-approved and safely on brand; not the genuine, fascinating weirdness of an industry outsider."
Kelechi Ehenulo,"Emotional with plenty of heart, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is hands down the best film in the trilogy and belongs at the elevated heights as a top-tier MCU film."
Alex Abad-Santos,Director James Gunn’s final Guardians chapter rips and roars with the confidence and emotions that nine years and multiple movies featuring this band of space underdogs bring.
Jonathan W. Hickman,This sweetly sentimental film is immensely entertaining.
Adam Graham,"... Now comes Vol. 3, which has the outsider emotion of ""Creep"" with none of the nuance. Its characters are either yelling their feelings at one another or their eyes are welling up with sadness, and there's no in between."
Erick Estrada,... Delivers the satisfaction of a broken record in a digital era. [Full review in Spanish]
Maan Jalal,What Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 achieves is ultimately a satisfying finale to a story of unforgettable characters.
Alex Bentley,"Vol. 3 is right up there among the best MCU films, with a blend of comedy and drama that can only exist in its galaxy."
Jack King,"[Guardians Vol. 3 is] the best Marvel since Avengers: Endgame. That may not immediately read as high praise given the dearth of quality in the interim, but the film has made one thing very clear: James Gunn really, really knows what he's doing."
Christian Holub,"It's always nice when superhero movies remember that they're supposed to be about saving lives rather than taking them, and GotG 3 often plays like a celebration of life — even for animals that can't talk or fly spaceships."
Trace Sauveur,"For a franchise in the throes of a post-Endgame wheel-spinning slump, and with a less-than-compelling upcoming slate of films, Guardians Vol. 3 is a refreshing, if overstuffed, respite."
George M. Thomas,"The performances prove to be on point, hitting the right notes. By the time the lights come up in the theater, many will realize these are characters they don’t want to say goodbye to."
Luke Goodsell,"Entertaining, surprisingly soulful and sometimes very weird."
Marcelo Stiletano,"A tireless creator of visual worlds full of ideas and revelations, some of them extraordinary, Gunn delivers an ending that captures the breath, fun and vital energy of the first two adventures... [Full review in Spanish]"
Victoria Luxford,"(The film) groans under the burden most Marvel movies suffer, having to be both a story for now & a trailer for what’s to come. However, Gunn leaves the MCU teaching it a valuable lesson: that making the stakes personal keeps the audience invested."
Pablo O. Scholz,This closure is a party of friends. [Full review in Spanish]
Frank Swietek,"Overstuffed and chaotic, veering wildly from tone to tone and winding up as a lumbering conclusion to a series that began as a comparatively light-footed part of the MCU."
George Simpson,"At times the plot felt a little messy with not all the characters having enough to do and it’s definitely too long, but it's a return to form for the MCU for sure."
Sean Collier,Writer/director James Gunn fundamentally misunderstood the boundaries of this cinematic reality.
Jonathan Romney,"It’s just a shame that after two enjoyably irreverent anomalies in the canon, Gunn’s finale should be so solemn, over-frenetic and at points, shamelessly sentimental."
Susan Kamyab,"The entire cast lands the comedy and conveys the heart of the story brilliantly. And even with a runtime of 2 and half hours, the film moves quickly thanks to an engaging plot, thrilling action sequences, and as always, a stellar soundtrack."
MontiLee Stormer,"I think 1 thing we should all remember is that Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 is a James Gunn movie and as such, feels like a symphony conducted by a child who has heard the music a hundred times, but has also had a box of Froot Loops and a 20oz Mtn Dew."
Michael J. Casey,"If anything, the letdown of ""Vol. 3"" isn’t all the scenes of torture, genetic mutation, incarceration and genocide; it’s that the movie is here for kicks and little else."
Mark Dujsik,"Leave it to the weirdos to bypass what's becoming the same, old same-old in this franchise."
Christopher Llewellyn Reed,"Here, the script delivers (and then some), and we end on a satisfying note that promises (maybe) more interesting stories to follow. And it’s all courtesy of a talking raccoon."
Barry Hertz,I am Groot … ly disappointed.
Anupama Chopra,"Despite the underwhelming Vol. 2 in 2017, James Gunn has created a singular band of eccentric misfits who inject a shot of buoyancy & joy into the superhero genre. The tag line of this film is: Once More with Feeling. And that’s pretty much what it is."
Richard Crouse,"By the time the end credits roll, it has become a loud, slightly over-long orgy of CGI, but James Gunn brings something most other superhero movies don’t have. Within the wham-bam action overload is a genuine sweetness that overrides the bombastic action."
Akhil Arora,"Sure, it’s morbid, maudlin, and flippant at the same time—but it’s also infectious and full of spirit. Gunn is hooked on a feeling and high on believing. It’s far from a smooth ride, it doesn’t always work, but it’s also the bittersweet end of an era."
Josh Bell,"As ungainly as it can be, Vol. 3 is still an entertaining ride, full of creatively designed alien worlds and vessels, with Iwuji as an enjoyably unhinged villain."
Korey Coleman,"As outlandish as all of this is, the ending feels natural. James Gunn lets the story write itself out."
Jim Schembri,"There might not be as many laughs but James Gunn again delivers a rollicking, robust space fantasy adventure that also chimes in as the most pro-raccoon movie ever made...It's also a significant marker in the accelerating downslide of Cancel Culture."
Michelle Kisner,"Although there are a few touching moments, for the most part, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is a convoluted work trying to juggle too many plotlines."
Paul Whitington,"It does drag on a bit towards the end but in the main, Guardians Vol 3 is witty, smart and consistently entertaining, one of the better Marvel outings of recent years."
Chris Wasser,"Gunn signs off on his epic trilogy with a devastating side tale that explains how Rocket the yappy racoon got his voice. It nearly broke me. Well played, everyone."
Cain Noble-Davies,"… an emotional impact that can rival any modern film, let alone superhero film."
Kristian M. Lin,One of the supporting characters is right: The whole Guardians of the Galaxy saga was always Rocket’s story rather than Star-Lord’s. Turning the series into that turns out to be a stroke of genius.
Peter Gray,"A course that needed correcting, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a healthy reminder of why we became so invested in these films in the first place."
Morgan Shaunette,"It does the same thing the previous movies did: shine a light on misfits and weirdos, celebrate their flaws and foibles, and prove that ingenuity, empathy and, yes, absolute silliness, are the most valuable forces in the galaxy."
John Lui,"Vol. 3 retains the Gunn edge, channelled through the perfectly cast troupe of actors making up the Guardians."
Graeme Tuckett,Gunn achieved something I was beginning to think Marvel couldn't do any more: he kept me engrossed throughout. Guardians 3 is also quite stunning to look at.
James Berardinelli,This is the least enjoyable of James Gunn’s trilogy.
Peter Howell,It says something about the current state of superhero movies that the fate of a small frightened raccoon makes a stronger tug on the heart than any imperilled person or planet in the relentless Marvel Cinematic Universe.
David Crow,Thank God that James Gunn is back in the MCU.
Brandon Avery,"The jokes and banter were hilarious even though some lingered on too long. However, director James Gunn loves the characters so much and it shows. This was an incredible conclusion to this Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy."
Bob Chipman,An emotionally resonant blockbuster (featuring Marvel's most evil villain ever!) that re-establishes James Gunn as one of the absolute top-class creators working in modern Hollywood. This is the one you've been waiting for - an absolute stunner.
Sherin Nicole,"There are three movies here and I like two of them. GotG3 can be snide and ridiculous but what makes it work is Gunn’s ability to find the heart of a story, ridicule or explode it, and allow it to envelope his audience."
J Hurtado,"Vol. 3 shifts the tonal balance away from the free-wheeling fun in an effort to give us a Return of the King-style victory lap, wrapping up a dozen stories all at once. It's heavy. Really heavy."
Perri Nemiroff,"Guardians movies are always a blast, but the beating heart of the series is the unlikely family and how they come to love and value one another. That element is as strong as ever in Vol. 3."
Randy Myers,"Where this Guardians excels, and other recent MCU releases have failed, is in delivering both action and the emotion — a tricky balancing act."
