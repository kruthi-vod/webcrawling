       " 'Noah Berlatsky': 'When the Guardians get into a big group hug at the end of the film, it’s supposed to evoke love and solidarity. But it might better be characterized as the unity of capital, determined to offend no one and turn no one’s dollars away.',\n",

       " 'Collin Garbarino': 'Gunn signals the somber direction in the opening scene and carries it through to the end credits. It’s not necessarily a darker movie, just \\xadsadder, and some fans won’t be \\xadprepared for the goofy franchise turning into a bit of a tear-jerker.',\n",
       " 'Lupe Rodriguez Haas': 'Cutting back and forth between the light-hearted moments with the Guardians, and young Rocket’s story is jarring in tone and slows down the pacing. It’s surprising Marvel Studios approved such morbid imagery of mutilated critters.',\n",
       " 'David Lynch': 'Gunn the true-blue genre imagineer has almost always been able to pick up the slack from Gunn the overcompensating writer, even as the latter can’t resist to show every character that speaks, roars or chortles how much he loves them.',\n",
       " 'Ruth Maramis': \"Gunn gets melancholic in his farewell to Marvel but hasn't lost his sense of fun. Rocket's backstory gets me bawling but there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to balance the somber mood.\",\n",

       " 'Andre Meadows': 'What really makes this movie work is that it has heart. You could just feel the love that is poured into this movie.',\n",
       " 'Nick Johnston': 'It’s often surprisingly effective at tugging on the viewer’s heartstrings. But that application of personal investment and care to an enterprise that would, in another’s hands, be soulless and generic is what Gunn did best during his time at Disney,',\n",
       " 'Kevin Carr': 'Less about Star Lord’s hang ups and more a character study of Rocket, this offers an intriguing diversion from the previous films.',\n",
       " 'Miles Surrey': 'Marvel will miss James Gunn more than Gunn will miss Marvel, but if there’s any way for the MCU to get out of its current funk, then ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’ should be the blueprint going forward.',\n",
       " 'Damond Fudge': 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is exciting, funny, heartbreakingly emotional and the perfect send-off...[it] proves that the “movie with the talking racoon” has come a long way…and burrowed itself deep into our hearts.',\n",
       " 'Thelma Adams': 'For \"Guardian\" junkies and kids of all stripes, this two-hour reunion with old character friends will have them singing Peaches & Herb’s 1978 soul classic “Reunited” -- and it feels so good.',\n",

       " 'Mike McGranaghan': 'Even if this third outing doesn’t quite hit the heights of Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, it still avoids the “been there, done that” quality that has felled a few of the other recent Marvel releases.',\n",
       " 'Doug Walker': \"Feels more like an imitation of a 'Guardians' movie rather than an actual 'Guardians' movie.\",\n",
       " 'Lyra Hale': 'GOT3 destroyed me because it made me self-reflect. And those are the kind of movies that stay with you. Because yes, this is a movie about aliens, epic battles in space, etc. But this is also a story about belonging and self-acceptance.',\n",
       " 'Radheyan Simonpillai': 'Flirts with being interesting but I checked out after the 90 minute mark with nearly an hour to go.',\n",

       " 'Ryan Syrek': 'As a fan of Cronenbergian body horror, is it hypocritical to find “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” repulsive for its copious CGI animal torture? No! Because fuzzy creatures didn’t invent genocide, Twitter, or the 50-hour work week.',\n",
       " 'Mathew DeKinder': '“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” hits all the quirky, comedic and heartfelt notes that made the first two movies such a blast.',\n",
       " 'Jeff Nelson': 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 concludes Gunn’s trilogy on a positive note, reminding us why we ever fell in love with this band of misfits, and giving us even more reasons to look back on their journey with fondness.',\n",
       " 'Aaron Peterson': 'Disney did the right thing by bringing Gunn back after unceremoniously firing him over years-old tweets. Gunn IS this franchise, and by doing so Disney saved the Guardians, our joy, and possibly the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole.',\n",
       " 'Chris Knight': 'Rocket’s backstory, though often overshadowed by exploding spaceships, space stations and planets, is actually kind of sweet. As an urban Canadian, I have to say that anything that makes me feel sympathy for a raccoon is clearly doing something right.',\n",
       " 'James Verniere': \"Gunn may have made a new version of Tod Browning's Freaks for the masses.\",\n",
       " 'Christopher Lloyd': 'More downbeat and grim, but still plenty of laughs and camaraderie in this final (?) outing for the galactic do-gooders.',\n",

       " 'Jeffrey Harris': \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3. is the most heart-wrenching, emotional adventure yet for the galaxy's biggest, most lovable misfits. James Gunn delivers a grand, yet poignant, sendoff for the Guardians. These morons will be missed.\",\n",
       " 'Gayle Sequeira': \"It doesn't entirely escape the fast-drying cement of MCU convention, but in true James Gunn style, it goes down swinging. It's an ode to the places we’ve been, the people we’ve become, and the questions we’ll have to ask ourselves about where we go next.\",\n",
       " 'Russ Simmons': '“Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3” is a snappy and involving comic book extravaganza.',\n",
       " 'Jeffrey M. Anderson': 'It will bring a smile to your face and perhaps a tear to your eye — and it is all-around lovable — but it needed a firmer hand.',\n",
       " 'Sean P. Means': 'Everything in “Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3” hints that this is our group’s last ride together, and that’s OK because it’s such an enjoyable ride.',\n",
       " 'Brian Eggert': 'Gunn’s work registers as that of a filmmaker with a personal vision for his comic book universe and the freedom to explore it.',\n",
       " 'Kyle Smith': 'GOTG 3 is a blahbuster that, like other recent Marvel disappointments, jogs along from one visually extravagant, strenuously jokey set piece to another without offering much in the way of either dramatic engagement or actually funny ideas.',\n",
       " 'Jeremy Jahns': 'Ironically -- and even sadly -- Guardians 3 feels more like a familiar MCU formula film, rather than the unique vision that started Guardians of the Galaxy in the first place.',\n",
       " 'Jake Wilson': 'Gunn wouldn’t be Gunn if he wasn’t compelled to mix sweetness with viciousness -- but... At this point the sadistic side of his imagination is out in the open.',\n",
       " 'Kate Rodger': '[Vol. 3] totally sticks the landing, bringing this beloved slice of the Marvel franchise to a nourishing close, dancing across the finish line to the tune of another blockbuster soundtrack and reminding me how much I just adore going to the movies.',\n",
       " 'Cody Leach': 'GOTG 3 brings big emotions, high stakes, and a refreshingly serious tone that add up to a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Weak villains and a thin story hold it back from true greatness but these characters & their dynamic continue to shine.',\n",
       " 'Preston Barta': \"'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' is about as exceptional as blockbuster entertainment gets. In many ways, it’s the 'Toy Story 3' of Marvel movies. It rocks!\",\n",
       " 'Donald Clarke': 'Watching the thing is like trying to drink water from something more powerful than the proverbial fire hose. It’s like putting your head back to be waterbombed by the same service’s aerial forest-fire team.',\n",
       " 'André Hereford': \"James Gunn closes his 'Guardians of the Galaxy' trilogy with more gravitas than goofiness amid rockin’ interstellar set-pieces.\",\n",
       " 'Robert Denerstein': 'At two hours and 29 minutes, Guardians can be accused of bloat. But Rocket’s origin story settles the movie down, building toward what many will regard as an emotionally satisfying conclusion.',\n",
       " 'Paul Salfen': \"The band has broken up, but maybe it's for the better. It's a bit of a downer. Some might love this one, but it made me long for when it felt like the first time.\",\n",
       " 'Bilge Ebiri': 'The big-picture elements of Guardians 3 work beautifully, but so do the specifics.',\n",
       " 'Juanma Fernández París': 'Gunn ingeniously reclaims each of the characters and gives them dramatic depth...',\n",
       " 'Nell Minow': 'Like its characters, a mess but a lovable and entertaining mess. By now it feels like it’s our mess. So, even though I couldn’t help imagining what Honest Trailers and Pitch Meeting are going to have so say about it, I enjoyed it',\n",
       " \"Conor O'Donnell\": 'All of this is funneled through a space oddity pastiche that feels pre-approved and safely on brand; not the genuine, fascinating weirdness of an industry outsider.',\n",
       " 'Kelechi Ehenulo': 'Emotional with plenty of heart, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is hands down the best film in the trilogy and belongs at the elevated heights as a top-tier MCU film.',\n",
       " 'Alex Abad-Santos': 'Director James Gunn’s final Guardians chapter rips and roars with the confidence and emotions that nine years and multiple movies featuring this band of space underdogs bring.',\n",
       " 'Jonathan W. Hickman': 'This sweetly sentimental film is immensely entertaining.',\n",
       " 'Adam Graham': '... Now comes Vol. 3, which has the outsider emotion of \"Creep\" with none of the nuance. Its characters are either yelling their feelings at one another or their eyes are welling up with sadness, and there\\'s no in between.',\n",
       " 'Erick Estrada': '... Delivers the satisfaction of a broken record in a digital era. [Full review in Spanish]',\n",
       " 'Maan Jalal': 'What Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 achieves is ultimately a satisfying finale to a story of unforgettable characters.',\n",
       " 'Alex Bentley': 'Vol. 3 is right up there among the best MCU films, with a blend of comedy and drama that can only exist in its galaxy.',\n",
       " 'Jack King': \"[Guardians Vol. 3 is] the best Marvel since Avengers: Endgame. That may not immediately read as high praise given the dearth of quality in the interim, but the film has made one thing very clear: James Gunn really, really knows what he's doing.\",\n",
       " 'Christian Holub': \"It's always nice when superhero movies remember that they're supposed to be about saving lives rather than taking them, and GotG 3 often plays like a celebration of life — even for animals that can't talk or fly spaceships.\",\n",
       " 'Trace Sauveur': 'For a franchise in the throes of a post-Endgame wheel-spinning slump, and with a less-than-compelling upcoming slate of films, Guardians Vol. 3 is a refreshing, if overstuffed, respite.',\n",
       " 'George M. Thomas': 'The performances prove to be on point, hitting the right notes. By the time the lights come up in the theater, many will realize these are characters they don’t want to say goodbye to.',\n",
       " 'Luke Goodsell': 'Entertaining, surprisingly soulful and sometimes very weird.',\n",
       " 'Marcelo Stiletano': 'A tireless creator of visual worlds full of ideas and revelations, some of them extraordinary, Gunn delivers an ending that captures the breath, fun and vital energy of the first two adventures... [Full review in Spanish]',\n",
       " 'Victoria Luxford': '(The film) groans under the burden most Marvel movies suffer, having to be both a story for now & a trailer for what’s to come. However, Gunn leaves the MCU teaching it a valuable lesson: that making the stakes personal keeps the audience invested.',\n",
       " 'Pablo O. Scholz': 'This closure is a party of friends. [Full review in Spanish]',\n",
       " 'Frank Swietek': 'Overstuffed and chaotic, veering wildly from tone to tone and winding up as a lumbering conclusion to a series that began as a comparatively light-footed part of the MCU.',\n",
       " 'George Simpson': \"At times the plot felt a little messy with not all the characters having enough to do and it’s definitely too long, but it's a return to form for the MCU for sure.\",\n",
       " 'Sean Collier': 'Writer/director James Gunn fundamentally misunderstood the boundaries of this cinematic reality.',\n",
       " 'Jonathan Romney': 'It’s just a shame that after two enjoyably irreverent anomalies in the canon, Gunn’s finale should be so solemn, over-frenetic and at points, shamelessly sentimental.',\n",
       " 'Susan Kamyab': 'The entire cast lands the comedy and conveys the heart of the story brilliantly. And even with a runtime of 2 and half hours, the film moves quickly thanks to an engaging plot, thrilling action sequences, and as always, a stellar soundtrack.',\n",
       " 'MontiLee Stormer': 'I think 1 thing we should all remember is that Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 is a James Gunn movie and as such, feels like a symphony conducted by a child who has heard the music a hundred times, but has also had a box of Froot Loops and a 20oz Mtn Dew.',\n",
       " 'Michael J. Casey': 'If anything, the letdown of \"Vol. 3\" isn’t all the scenes of torture, genetic mutation, incarceration and genocide; it’s that the movie is here for kicks and little else.',\n",
       " 'Mark Dujsik': \"Leave it to the weirdos to bypass what's becoming the same, old same-old in this franchise.\",\n",
       " 'Christopher Llewellyn Reed': 'Here, the script delivers (and then some), and we end on a satisfying note that promises (maybe) more interesting stories to follow. And it’s all courtesy of a talking raccoon.',\n",
       " 'Barry Hertz': 'I am Groot … ly disappointed.',\n",
       " 'Anupama Chopra': 'Despite the underwhelming Vol. 2 in 2017, James Gunn has created a singular band of eccentric misfits who inject a shot of buoyancy & joy into the superhero genre. The tag line of this film is: Once More with Feeling. And that’s pretty much what it is.',\n",
       " 'Richard Crouse': 'By the time the end credits roll, it has become a loud, slightly over-long orgy of CGI, but James Gunn brings something most other superhero movies don’t have. Within the wham-bam action overload is a genuine sweetness that overrides the bombastic action.',\n",
       " 'Akhil Arora': 'Sure, it’s morbid, maudlin, and flippant at the same time—but it’s also infectious and full of spirit. Gunn is hooked on a feeling and high on believing. It’s far from a smooth ride, it doesn’t always work, but it’s also the bittersweet end of an era.',\n",
       " 'Josh Bell': 'As ungainly as it can be, Vol. 3 is still an entertaining ride, full of creatively designed alien worlds and vessels, with Iwuji as an enjoyably unhinged villain.',\n",
       " 'Korey Coleman': 'As outlandish as all of this is, the ending feels natural. James Gunn lets the story write itself out.',\n",
       " 'Jim Schembri': \"There might not be as many laughs but James Gunn again delivers a rollicking, robust space fantasy adventure that also chimes in as the most pro-raccoon movie ever made...It's also a significant marker in the accelerating downslide of Cancel Culture.\",\n",
       " 'Michelle Kisner': 'Although there are a few touching moments, for the most part, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is a convoluted work trying to juggle too many plotlines.',\n",
       " 'Paul Whitington': 'It does drag on a bit towards the end but in the main, Guardians Vol 3 is witty, smart and consistently entertaining, one of the better Marvel outings of recent years.',\n",
       " 'Chris Wasser': 'Gunn signs off on his epic trilogy with a devastating side tale that explains how Rocket the yappy racoon got his voice. It nearly broke me. Well played, everyone.',\n",
       " 'Cain Noble-Davies': '… an emotional impact that can rival any modern film, let alone superhero film.',\n",
       " 'Kristian M. Lin': 'One of the supporting characters is right: The whole Guardians of the Galaxy saga was always Rocket’s story rather than Star-Lord’s. Turning the series into that turns out to be a stroke of genius.',\n",
       " 'Peter Gray': 'A course that needed correcting, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a healthy reminder of why we became so invested in these films in the first place.',\n",
       " 'Morgan Shaunette': 'It does the same thing the previous movies did: shine a light on misfits and weirdos, celebrate their flaws and foibles, and prove that ingenuity, empathy and, yes, absolute silliness, are the most valuable forces in the galaxy.',\n",
       " 'John Lui': 'Vol. 3 retains the Gunn edge, channelled through the perfectly cast troupe of actors making up the Guardians.',\n",
       " 'Graeme Tuckett': \"Gunn achieved something I was beginning to think Marvel couldn't do any more: he kept me engrossed throughout. Guardians 3 is also quite stunning to look at.\",\n",
       " 'James Berardinelli': 'This is the least enjoyable of James Gunn’s trilogy.',\n",
       " 'Peter Howell': 'It says something about the current state of superhero movies that the fate of a small frightened raccoon makes a stronger tug on the heart than any imperilled person or planet in the relentless Marvel Cinematic Universe.',\n",
       " 'David Crow': 'Thank God that James Gunn is back in the MCU.',\n",
       " 'Brandon Avery': 'The jokes and banter were hilarious even though some lingered on too long. However, director James Gunn loves the characters so much and it shows. This was an incredible conclusion to this Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy.',\n",
       " 'Bob Chipman': \"An emotionally resonant blockbuster (featuring Marvel's most evil villain ever!) that re-establishes James Gunn as one of the absolute top-class creators working in modern Hollywood. This is the one you've been waiting for - an absolute stunner.\",\n",
       " 'Sherin Nicole': 'There are three movies here and I like two of them. GotG3 can be snide and ridiculous but what makes it work is Gunn’s ability to find the heart of a story, ridicule or explode it, and allow it to envelope his audience.',\n",
       " 'J Hurtado': \"Vol. 3 shifts the tonal balance away from the free-wheeling fun in an effort to give us a Return of the King-style victory lap, wrapping up a dozen stories all at once. It's heavy. Really heavy.\",\n",
       " 'Perri Nemiroff': 'Guardians movies are always a blast, but the beating heart of the series is the unlikely family and how they come to love and value one another. That element is as strong as ever in Vol. 3.',\n",
       " 'Randy Myers': 'Where this Guardians excels, and other recent MCU releases have failed, is in delivering both action and the emotion — a tricky balancing act.'}"
